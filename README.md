You need to install a couple of things to get it to work

    chicken-install glm glut gl 

It's possible that other things are missing. The opengl bindings from Chicken-scheme won't
work. You can get them from this repository: https://github.com/llacroix/chicken-opengl-bindings

If everything work, you should be able to compile the `main.scm` file.

    csc main.scm

Start a project with

    ./main [folder]

    ./main cubex # will start the cubex program

What is it?
===================

I wouldn't say that it is a useable engine yet and probably not soon. The main purpose
of this project is to learn scheme in a fun way. Bored of doing some console program...
bored of doing websites? Well Opengl is a nice thing that has been around for a while

Scheme has been there for a while too...and I feel that people forgot what having fun
is all about. So I'm bringing those two old things together and try to make it shine
like millions of rainbows.
